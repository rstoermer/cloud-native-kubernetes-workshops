## TL;DR

**Cloud-native & Kubernetes Campfire 🔥 — 30-minute live-coding sessions**
**When:** bi-weekly in Teams • **Repo:** [https://github.com/rstoermer/cloud-native-kubernetes-workshops](https://github.com/rstoermer/cloud-native-kubernetes-workshops)
**Please forward to interested colleagues & reach out if you’d like to present!**

## What is it?

**Short hands-on sessions — 30 minutes incl. Q&A**

Learn cloud-native and Kubernetes in short, practical examples. We’ll mix basics and advanced topics so there’s something for everyone—whether you’re shipping your first Pod or tuning clusters at the edge.

## Why join?

* **Live-coding first.** No talk, practical code instead.
* **Broad & flexible.** Topics jump between levels to keep it fresh.
* **Best Practices.** Learn from years of real-world experience.

## Format

Mostly **live-coding** (with the repo above). Sometimes we’ll swap in best-practices shares or tackle a real-world problem together.
Sessions are **30 minutes** with time for questions. Just raise your virtual hand or drop a comment in chat.

## Schedule

We’ll start **bi-weekly** and may switch to weekly based on interest.
All sessions run in an **internal Teams meeting**. Materials will be committed to the repo to follow along or catch up afterwards.
